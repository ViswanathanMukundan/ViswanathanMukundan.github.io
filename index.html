                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <h4> Currently an undergraduate in Information Technology at Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4> My introduction to coding was purely out of necessity and not interest. When choosing streams after Class 10, I decided to go with Computer Science as the other options (Commerce and Biology) were too complicated. Programming started off with C++. And that got me hooked for life. What started off with basic programs like simple calculators, pattern printing, etc. has now evolved into a more challenging, and totally interesting domain with deep learning, neural networks, and more. I now feel that my approaching the subject with lots of enthusiasm in the early days and understanding the basics has now enabled me to seek out and approach complex problems on my own.
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        I'm passionate about trending topics such as:<br><br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Mathematics (though not trending). </li><br>
                            <li> Neural Networks. </li><br>
                            <li> Machine Learning. </li><br>
                            <li> Natural Language Processing. </li><br>
                            <li> Cloud Computing </li><br>
                            <li> Python Programming. </li><br>
                        </ul><br><br>
                        Currently my preferred programming language is Python. I love Python for it's versatility, simplicity, and the fact that there is a predefined, open-source library for almost everything I'm interested in.

                        Since life isn't all about work, here's a list of possible things I can be found doing when not coding/working:
                        <br><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Driving around aimlessly. </li><br>
                    <li> Curled up silently with a nice book. </li><br>
                    <li> Enjoying a nice game of tennis. </li><br>
                    <li> Contemplating 42 (Ref: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy). </li><br>
                    <li> Listening to music. </li><br>
                    <li> Spending quality time with my family. </li>
